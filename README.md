### qr-generator
`A program for generating QR code for any request`


The program can generate a QR code based on the entered data, be it a word, a numerical value, or a link.
All saved codes are automatically saved in the `saved/"yyyy/mm/dd"`.
They can be distinguished by their Unique ID as well as the entered value, which is substituted into the name of the finished QR code.
